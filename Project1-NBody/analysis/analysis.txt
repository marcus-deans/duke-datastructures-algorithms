INSTRUCTIONS for Analysis Part

This file contains questions for the analysis part of the assignment.
You will need to copy these questions, answer them and save it as a .pdf. You
may want to copy them into a program such as Word or Google Docs and when finished
save it as a .pdf.

You'll submit the .PDF version of your analysis as a separate submission on Gradescope.

Copy/paste the output of your simulation when using planets.txt,
running the simulation for 1,000,000 (one  million) seconds, and
with a time-step/dt value of 25,000

(replace with copy/paste)

Copy/paste the output of your simulation when using planets.txt,
running the simulation for 2,000,000 (two  million) seconds, and
with a time-step/dt value of 25,000

(replace with copy/paste)

Run the simulation for a billion seconds (10^9) and a time-step/dt
of a million. You should see behavior inconsistent with what is
expected for celestial bodies. This is due to large values of dt
when approximating forces. Write down below what you see during
this simulation.

(replace with observed behavior)

Run the simulation with the original time and dt values which are

double totalTime = 39447000.0;
double dt = 25000.0;

But use the input data file "data/kaleidoscope.txt".
In fewer than 50 words describe the visualization you observe.
