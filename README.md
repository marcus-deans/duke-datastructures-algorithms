# duke-datastructures-algorithms

I took Duke CompSci 201 in Spring 2020, focusing on the below topics:

"Analysis, use, and design of data structures and algorithms using an object-oriented language like Java to solve computational problems. Emphasis on abstraction including interfaces and abstract data types for lists, trees, sets, tables/maps, and graphs. Implementation and evaluation of programming techniques including recursion. Intuitive and rigorous analysis of algorithms."

Algorithmic Problem-solving Testing (APT) problems are relatively short coding challenges consisting of a program description and desired output.
